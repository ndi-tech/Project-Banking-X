 Overview
This educational project demonstrates a complete attack chain against a simulated banking application, highlighting critical security vulnerabilities and their corresponding defenses. Built for educational purposes only, this lab environment safely illustrates how attackers exploit common weaknesses and how developers can prevent them.

Core Objective: To understand and demonstrate the "Defense in Depth" principle by:

Identifying and exploiting common web vulnerabilities

Chaining multiple weaknesses for full system compromise

Implementing and validating security controls
  Features
 Technical Capabilities
User Enumeration Tool: Discovers valid usernames via error message analysis

Quantum Brute-Force Simulator: GUI and terminal-based password cracking demonstrations

Session Hijacking Demo: Illustrates cookie theft and session fixation risks

Post-Compromise Simulation: Shows financial impact and privilege escalation

Defense Implementations: Working examples of security controls

  Visual Demos
Terminal Matrix Edition	GUI Popup Edition

 Attack Chain Demonstrated
This project demonstrates a complete attack chain:

 Reconnaissance: Information gathering via error message analysis

 Initial Access: Credential cracking through targeted brute-forcing

 Privilege Escalation: Session hijacking and admin access exploitation

 Impact Demonstration: Simulated financial theft and data exfiltration

 Defense Implementation: Security control deployment and validation

 Quick Start
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher

Kali Linux or similar security-focused distribution

Virtual environment tools (venv)

Installation
bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/banking-security-demo.git
cd banking-security-demo

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
🔧 Detailed Setup
1. Environment Configuration
bash
# For Kali Linux (handles externally managed environment)
python3 -m venv ~/demo_env
source ~/demo_env/bin/activate

# Install required packages
pip install colorama requests
2. Running Demonstrations
User Enumeration Demo:

bash
python scripts/enumerate_users.py --target http://localhost/banking-tutorial/
Brute-Force Simulator (GUI):

bash
python scripts/quantum_gui.py
Complete Attack Chain:

bash
python demonstrations/complete_demo.py
📊 Usage Examples
Example 1: User Enumeration
python
# Customize target and wordlist
from scripts.enumerate_users import UserEnumerator

scanner = UserEnumerator(
    target_url="http://localhost:8080/login",
    user_wordlist="wordlists/common_users.txt"
)
valid_users = scanner.enumerate()
print(f"Found {len(valid_users)} valid user accounts")
Example 2: Defense Implementation
python
# See defenses/ directory for complete examples
from defenses.rate_limiting import RateLimiter

limiter = RateLimiter(max_attempts=5, lockout_time=300)
if limiter.check_attempt(user_ip):
    # Process login
    pass
else:
    # Account locked
    print("Account temporarily locked due to suspicious activity")
